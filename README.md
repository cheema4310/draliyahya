# Dr. Ali Yahya — CV / Executive Portfolio Website

A fast-turnaround personal CV / executive portfolio website built for a college friend (Doctor + CEO) who needed an urgent online presence.

- **Live Demo:** https://www.draliyahya.com/

---

## Project Background

This site was initially generated via **prompting (Google AI Studio / Gemini)** to get a working first version quickly.  
After the scaffold, I manually improved:

- Layout refinements + Provide Socials (Link + Design)
- image upload / image handling adjustments + Favicons
- content corrections (headings, copy and displayed information)

---

## Features (Typical CV Site Sections)

- Hero / headline section
- About / bio
- Experience / leadership highlights
- Achievements / credentials (as needed)
- Contact section
- Clean, responsive layout (portfolio-style)

> Section titles and exact layout may differ based on the current code, but the goal is a complete CV-style one-page website.
